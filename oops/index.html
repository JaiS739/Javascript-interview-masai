    <h1>oops concepts</h1>
    <p>combining classed and objects is called oops.</p>
    <p>classes was introduced in the ES6 2015</p>
    <p>
      if objects share the same key or properties then we can use class instead
      of making lots of objects
    </p>
    <h2>
      It is type of function, but in place of keyword function we write class.
      We will assigned the properties in the constructor
    </h2>
    <h3>
      It is a user defined prototype or blueprint which can be used to create
      multiple objects.
    </h3>

  class Students {
    // this contructor has properties which can be inherit during object creation:-
    constructor(name, age, sub) {
      this.myname = name;
      this.myage = age;
      this.mysub = sub;
    }
    biodata() {
      return `hi this is ${this.myname} , i am ${this.myage} old`;
    }
  }

  // now inheriting the properties of Students class by using extends and super keyword:-

  class Player extends Students {
    constructor(name, age, sub, game) {
      super(name, age, sub);
      this.mygame = game;
    }
    myGameData() {
      return `${super.biodata()}, I am player of ${this.mygame}`;
    }
  }

  let std1 = new Player("jai", 27, "FSD", "cricket");
  console.log(std1.myGameData());
